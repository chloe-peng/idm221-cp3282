                    <p>Currently a second-year student studying <b>User Experience & Interaction Design</b> @ Drexel University. My focus is on researching user needs and designing interfaces that will effectively meet them using data-driven insights.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise as a Brooklyn native, I've developed an appreciation for multiple medias of art at a young age. From dance, music, photography, creative writing until I landed on design.</p>

                    <h2>On a more personal level</h2>
                    <p>If you met me about 5 years ago, I would've never imagined myself here. After graduating from a very competitive STEM focused high school, creative fields felt like a mile away. But from my love of playing the piano, and dancing on stage, I realized they weren't as far as I thought.</p>

                    <h2>My strongest tool: Curiousity</h2>
                    <p>The root of design lies in diversifying our own human experiences. Back in NYC, I saw the unique experiences of communities I cross paths with go through that get glossed over. Ever since moving to Philly, my drive to change the ways human interact has only grown with the rise of new technologies.</p>

                    <p>I've always been passionate about reconnecting with my heritage. I spend most of my free time working alongside cultural organizations or learning Cantonese to expand my knowledge and scope of life. By doing so, I'm dedicated to finding the universal language that everyone can speak to.</p>
