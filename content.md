# About
## Introduction 
### A Letter from Me, to You
### To ____,
Hey! I’m Chloe and currently studying User Experience and Interaction Design @ Drexel University. As a UX designer, I'm focused on researching user needs and designing interfaces that effectively meet them using data-driven insights. 
### But on a more personal level
If you met me about 5 years ago, I would’ve never imagined myself here. After graduating from a very competitive STEM focused school, my routine was always calculated in quantities. From the time I'd go to bed to complete my sleep cycles efficiently to figuring out how to maximize my 8-minute breaks from physics. Creative fields felt like a mile away, but they weren’t as far as I thought.
### The strongest tool I had was...
Human empathy. Over time I’ve come to realize that apart from analytical thinking, the root of design lies in diversifying our own human experiences. Back in NYC, everyday was filled with wild stories. I saw first hand the unique experiences that communities we cross paths with each day go through due to unsubstantial efforts to provide them the opportunities and resources they need. Ever since moving to Philly, my drive to change the ways human interact has only grown 
### Moving forward,
I’ve always been passionate about Asian American advocacy and spend my free time connecting with others' cultures outside of my own that are also interested in connecting the dots between experiences all immigrants face. By integrating myself into the works of cultural organizations, I plan on incorporating the different experiences and voices of people in the community in my works.

# Visuals
## Graphic Design
### Color Studies
I embraced the challenge of using randomly generated color palettes to guide the creative process. Instead of selecting hues based on preconceived ideas, I allowed the palette to dictate the imagery, encouraging a deeper exploration of color relationships and associations.

Through this process, I aimed to show how color, when left to chance, can inspire both the subject matter and the mood of the piece, while revealing the surprising ways in which color influences perception and storytelling in art.

## Photography
### Black & White Study
What happens when color is fully stripped from an image? In this collection, I chose to explore that very question by focusing on the raw essence of shape, form, and space. Without the distraction of color, the eye is drawn to the subtleties of light, shadow, and texture, allowing the composition to speak more powerfully. 

Inspired by Japanese aesthetics, I reflected my selections based on the “Wabi-Sabi” concept which embraces finding beauty in things that are natural, understated, and unadorned.

### Humans and Nature
In this photography collection, I focused on exploring the contrast between man and nature, capturing the tension and harmony that coexist in their interaction. Through my lens, I sought to highlight how human structures and interventions—buildings or machinery—stand in stark contrast to the organic forms and textures found in the natural world.

The rigid lines and geometries of man-made elements often juxtaposed with the fluid, unpredictable patterns of nature. Yet, in some frames, there's an undeniable connection

## Social Media Work
### CACF
Over the summer of 2024, I was able to work with the Coalition for Asian American Children and Families, the only pan-Asian advocacy organization in the nation, as their communications intern. While I was there, I was able to streamline their process of creating social media posts by crafting templates that were both attention grabbing and informative

With a mission to bring attention to National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month, I worked alongside Medha Ghosh, previous Senior Coordinator for Health Equity, in developing a storytelling narrate to encourage viewers to read CACF’s report on “Collective Healing: Moving Towards A More Community-Centered Approach to AAPI Mental Health Care.” By designing a slideshow with vibrant colors and easy-to-read text, the mission was successfully accomplished.
