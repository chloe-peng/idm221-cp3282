Chloe Peng's Portfolio

This project is a redesign of my portfolio website, created using only HTML and CSS. It emphasizes design principles like information hierarchy and seamless site navigation. The site is optimized for mobile and small screens, incorporating a beginner-friendly responsive design approach. It is hosted on Netlify, and the live version is available [here](https://idm221-cp3282.netlify.app/).
