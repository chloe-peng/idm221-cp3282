Chloe Peng's Portfolio

Using only HTML & CSS, this project is a redesign of my portfolio website focusing on design elements such as information hierarchy and across site navigation. This website is only designed for mobile/small screens but with a beginners responsive approach. The website is officially avaliable through Netlify hosting platform and the launched website can be found [here](https://idm221-cp3282.netlify.app/).
